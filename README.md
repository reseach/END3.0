# END3.0 Assignment 1

Assignment:

1. Rewrite the Colab file and 

      i.remove the last activation function
      
      ii. make sure there are in total 44 parameters
      
      iii. run it for 2001 epochs

2. You must upload your assignment to a public GitHub Repository and share the link as the submission to this assignment 

3. Add a readme file to your project and describe these things:

      i. What is a neural network neuron?

      ii. What is the use of the learning rate?

      iii. How are weights initialized?

      iv. What is "loss" in a neural network?

      v. What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?

4. This assignment is worth 300pts (150 for Code, and 150 for your readme file (directly proportional to your description). 

Answers:

i. What is a neural network neuron?
Answer: An artificial neural network neuron is a mathematical function that forms the building block of a an artificial neural network. These artificiaol neurons when stacken up as multiple layers, enable compositional power of an artificial neural network. A neural network neuron is loosely inspired by the information processing structure of a brain albeit in a simple form. A neural network neuron taken mutiple inputs and sums them up to produce an output which is passed through a non-linear (activation/transfer) function.
